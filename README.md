# Project description

  In this project, I have implemented communication between the React web application and the FireBase database. The main idea is that by QR code the user will get into this web application, where he is given the opportunity to evaluate the quality of the lecture passed.

  The project implements the functionality of the uniqueness of each voice. That is, each user has the opportunity to vote once. For this I used localStorage.
